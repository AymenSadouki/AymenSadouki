First year cybersecurity student with hands on experience in digital forensics, secure system development, and security analysis through academic projects. Developed practical skills in:

- Threat Detection & Analysis: Conducted forensic investigations (Autopsy) to uncover evidence in a theft case using metadata analysis, password cracking (Caesar cipher), and hash verification (MD5/SHA-256).

- Secure Software Development: Built a Java-based hotel booking system with input validation, role based access logic, and file based data protection.

- Authentication Security: Implemented a secure login system with SHA-256 + salt hashing, account lockout, and secret question recovery.

- Web Security: Designed a smartphone review website (PHP/JavaScript) while learning client side security best practices.
